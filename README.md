# AIHaikuGenerator  
Run sip_displayer.py to get your SIPs!  
SIP stands for Short Issa Poem. This model is trained on English translations of Issa's Japanese haiku, so the training data does not adhere to the 5-7-5 syllable format.  

The model save files for v3 are too large to upload to the repo, so they are listed under [.gitignore](.gitignore).
